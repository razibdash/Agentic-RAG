      "content='In the context of transformers, attention refers to a mechanism that allows the model to focus on specific parts of the input sequence when processing it. This is particularly useful when dealing with long-range dependencies or when the input sequence has a complex structure.\\n\\nIn traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs), the model processes the input sequence sequentially, one element at a time. However, this can lead to difficulties when dealing with long-range dependencies, as the model may not be able to capture information that is relevant but far away in the sequence.\\n\\nTransformers, on the other hand, use self-attention mechanisms to allow the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously. This is achieved by computing a weighted sum of the input sequence, where the weights are learned during training and reflect the importance of each element in the sequence.\\n\\nThe attention mechanism in transformers is typically implemented using three main components:\\n\\n1. **Query** (Q): This is the input sequence that the model wants to attend to.\\n2. **Key** (K): This is the input sequence that the model uses to compute the weights for attention.\\n3. **Value** (V): This is the input sequence that the model uses to compute the output.\\n\\nThe attention mechanism works as follows:\\n\\n1. Compute the dot product of the query and key matrices to get a matrix of attention weights.\\n2. Apply a softmax function to the attention weights to get a probability distribution over the input sequence.\\n3. Compute the weighted sum of the value matrix using the attention weights as weights.\\n\\nThe output of the attention mechanism is a weighted sum of the input sequence, where the weights reflect the importance of each element in the sequence. This output is then used as input to the next layer in the transformer.\\n\\nThere are different types of attention mechanisms used in transformers, including:\\n\\n* **Self-attention**: This is the most common type of attention, where the model attends to different parts of the input sequence itself.\\n* **Encoder-decoder attention**: This is used in sequence-to-sequence tasks, where the model attends to the input sequence when generating the output sequence.\\n* **Multi-head attention**: This is a variant of self-attention that allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence in parallel.\\n\\nOverall, the attention mechanism in transformers is a key component that allows the model to capture long-range dependencies and process input sequences with complex structures.' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 483, 'prompt_tokens': 16, 'total_tokens': 499, 'completion_time': 0.624960004, 'prompt_time': 0.00561709, 'queue_time': 0.26746989, 'total_time': 0.630577094}, 'model_name': 'llama3-8b-8192', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5b339000ab', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run--67dc3db2-6190-47fc-8957-58b48b1cd161-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 16, 'output_tokens': 483, 'total_tokens': 499}\n"

At the time, the focus of the research was on improving seq2seq for machine translation, by removing its recurrence to process all tokens in parallel, but preserving its dot-product attention mechanism to keep its text processing performance.( This led to the introduction of a multi-head attention model that was easier to parallelize due to the use of independent heads and [...] The paper is most well known for the introduction of the Transformer architecture, which forms the underlying architecture for most forms of modern Large Language Models (LLMs). A key reason for why the architecture is preferred by most modern LLMs is the parallelizability of the architecture over its predecessors. This ensures that the operations necessary for training can be accelerated on a GPU allowing both faster training times and models of bigger sizes to be trained.\n"
